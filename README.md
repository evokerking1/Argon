# Argon master repository

Argon is built of 3 different modules:
- core: This is the API that is used by the frontend, it manages everything panel-side for Argon.
- ui: This is what you see.
- krypton: The Daemon that runs on your nodes, sort of like Pterodactyl Wings.

All are required to run the Argon Panel.
